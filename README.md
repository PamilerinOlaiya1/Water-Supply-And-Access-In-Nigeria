# Water-Supply-And-Access-In-Nigeria

## Introduction

My team and I did a  study which  focuses on the issue of water supply and access in Nigeria, which is a major concern across the country. As a team, we agreed to work on this topic because it is a pressing issue that affects
many communities and deserves more attention. To support our research, we designed a questionnaire and shared it with respondents from different parts of Nigeria, covering all six geo-political zones. This helped us gather real 
insights into how people experience water challenges in their daily lives.

## Problem Statement
Access to safe and affordable water in Nigeria remains unequal, with rural areas and certain regions facing greater challenges. Many households still rely on unsafe or distant water sources, spend heavily on water, or do not treat 
it before consumption—leading to health risks. This study investigates water accessibility, quality, and treatment across Nigeria's geopolitical zones, highlighting disparities by age, gender, region, and settlement type. The goal 
is to generate data-driven insights that can guide policies to improve water safety and equity nationwide.

## Objectives

- Analyze the link between water access and health issues in different zones
- Evaluate water accessibility across regions and between urban and rural areas
- Identify common household water treatment methods and their effectiveness
- Recommend improvements for water infrastructure and public health based on findings

## Methodology

### Study Population and Location
The study was conducted in Nigeria, with responses spanning across all six geopolitical zones. Data was collected from both rural and urban areas, providing a comprehensive overview of water access, treatment practices, and related health
issues across different regions.

### Data Collection & Analysis Process

1. **Data Collection**: Primary data was collected through an online questionnaire distributed across Nigeria's six geopolitical zones
2. **Data Analysis**: The responses were cleaned and organized using Microsoft Excel, and analyzed and visualized using Power BI to identify patterns and insights
3. **Results**: Findings were compiled and presented with visualizations

 ## Key Findings Overview
The majority of respondents were young adults (ages 21–30), with slightly more males than females participating. Most responses came from urban areas, particularly from the South West and North Central regions, indicating a possible urban bias
in the dataset. Still, the results reflect broader trends affecting both urban and rural populations.

### Water Accessibility
Boreholes are the most common source of water, followed by wells and packaged water. However, not all households have reliable access to safe water sources. Infrastructure remains a challenge, especially in rural areas where piped water and 
public taps are scarce. While many people live close to their water source, issues like cost, poor quality, and infrastructure failure remain significant barriers.On average, households spend ₦616.67 per week on water — a considerable expense 
that may push some toward cheaper, less-safe alternatives.

### Water Quality and Treatment
Over half of the respondents do not treat their water before consumption, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases. Boiling, chlorine, and filtering are the most commonly used treatment methods, but adoption is inconsistent. Alarmingly, 34.67% of respondents reported experiencing illnesses linked to poor water quality, highlighting serious public health concerns.There is also a noticeable gap in awareness and availability of treatment options, particularly in regions outside the more developed South West and North Central zones.

## Key Insights

- 56% of households do not treat their water, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases
- Cost is the major challenge to accessing clean water, followed by concerns about water quality
- Many households spend an average of ₦616.67 weekly, which may make them choose cheaper but unsafe water options to save money
- Safe water access is uneven, with better infrastructure in the Southwest and North Central zones
- Chlorination is more common in regions with better access, showing gaps in awareness and availability elsewhere
- 34.67% of respondents reported water-related illnesses, highlighting serious public health risks linked to poor water quality

## Recommendations

1. Invest in safe water infrastructure (especially in rural areas)
2. Promote low-cost water treatment methods
3. Launch community education campaigns on water safety
4. Target zones with high rates of illnesses for intervention
5. Encourage policies supporting piped and borehole access

## Limitations and Challenges

While this study aims to provide insights into water supply and access across Nigeria, the sample size of 150 respondents is not fully representative of the country's population of over 200 million. Time constraints also limited the volume of data collected. Therefore, the findings should be interpreted with caution and may not be generalized to the entire Nigerian population.
